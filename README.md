A GraphQL over Websocket Stream-based Transport Layer on Akka.

## Setup

**Latest Version**: `1.0.0`

```

## GraphQL Over Websockets

In the GraphQL world, we have the concept of a "subscription" which is a request from the client to subscribe a stream
of data that is sent from the server. This is usually done using websocket with a additional subprotocol.

This package is a websocket transport layer for managing, encoding, and
decoding [Sangria](https://github.com/sangria-graphql/sangria-akka-streams) stream based operations into the proper
sub-protocol format using Akka Actors.
